</p><p>
</p><p>I fired it up today and followed all of your break in instructions. It went without a hitch! I just turned the key and it was running. (I’m sure glad that I ran the oil pump with the electric drill to pre-prime every thing) I don’t think it turned over 2 revolutions before it fired on! I changed the oil and checked the plugs after the cam break in period as instructed. Then came the surprise! As I let out the clutch for the first time and gently&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">rolled away for the house, I stepped on the gas as I normally would have with the old engine. All I could say was Ooooh Shiiit. I quickly backed off. I just about gave my neighbor and my self whiplash. Its very snappy!</span></p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>
</p><p>After a few miles I did as you instructed and got on it a little. I was shocked to say the least! From a 15-20 mph roll I stepped on it. My 37″ tires started to get loose and talk back! I grabbed second gear (as quick and slow as you can with a stock trans) and my 37′s talked back again! Not just a chirp but a good long BARK! When I came back to the house my neighbors were talking. (They are all Jeep nuts as well) Nobody could believe that a Jeep I6 could perform as this one did!Later in the day I went over to Maple Hill and again I was super surprised. In the past I would run 2nd gear at 4000rpm and then attempt to shift into 3rd just to fall on its face and then have to down shift back into 2nd. Well on this day I cruised it in 4th!!! I even had to let off on it so that I wasn’t speeding! (I didn’t try 5th as I am sure that it would have lugged).</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>I have to say that I am very, very impressed with this 4.6 Jeep. It wont beat my old 67 GT500 Mustang but it will give my 03 Eclipse V6 a run for the money though! I want to get it on the dyno this week so that I can get the timing, fuel pressure and the map all adjusted correctly. I cant wait to hit the trails with it.</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for all that you have done!Very Happy Jeep 4.6 I6 Owner</p><p><br></p><p>

                    <p>Dear Chad, 
<br>
<br>I just wanted to say thanks for all of your help with my Jeep 4.6L swap. When my 4.0L died I considered my options for replacements. Its my daily driver, but I’ve lifted it for occasional off road trips and backcountry hunting trips. Reliability was my primary goal but more power would be an important bonus. 
<br>
<br>There isn’t a lot of places that build performance inline 6 cylinder engines for Jeeps, so finding one with outstanding customer service has been a definite plus. Right from the start I was impressed with the fact that it was the owner who took my call and answered all my questions and told me what to expect. He talked to me like I was an old friend. I placed my order and my engine was built ahead of schedule. It arrived in a massive wooden crate that is so sturdy, I now use it as a work bench. 
<br>
<br>Since I was doing this swap by myself, I cannot over emphasize how reassuring it was to have someone to call for advice. A few times, I called so many times, that I worried that I might be wearing out my welcome. But every time Chad answered the phone and talked me through what I had to do. At one point it occurred to me that every time I did call, I wasn’t patched through a secretary to a tech specialist or any crap like that. Every time I called, it was who Chad answered the phone. 
<br>
<br>With my engine installed it was time to start it up and break it in. Since I’ve never swapped in a new engine before, I followed Chad’s directions to the letter. I doubt if the starter engaged more than a dozen teeth before the engine roared to life and completed the cam break in. Then the trouble started. On the road the Jeep would launch like a dragster then sputter and choke. The tachometer was unstable and it would occasionally just stall. Once again the frantic calls to Chad were answered with a very methodical voice of reason. One potential issue after another was addressed in a calm logical manner, until the culprit, (a faulty JET Performance piggyback computer chip) was removed. Finally the fun could begin. 
<br>
<br>All I can say is, wow! It’s like having a V-8 but with added reliability and better gas economy. My Jeep Grand Cherokee has almost 1000 pounds of extra weight in after market skids and armor, (3650lbs. stock, 4590lbs. now) but it can blow the doors of my stock 1998 Grand Cherokee, or my sons stock 1995 Grand. With 4.10 gears and 31″ MT’s it pulls like mad off the line and gets even stronger all the way through 3500 rpm. I haven’t taken it past 70mph, but at 65mph, it just hums like an electric motor. Now with 650 miles of hard, break in miles on the clock, I am amazed to see that I am still getting 16+mpg. Once I start to drive normal again I will probably see 18 – 20 mpg. Mine and my sons stock ZJ’s get about that. 
<br>
<br>The quality of work is documented perfection. The engine is simply fantastic. But that would be useless if not for the personal service that Chad provided for me. Doing a job like this is stressful especially when its your first time and your doing it by yourself. From beginning to happy ending, I never felt alone. 
<br>
<br>Thanks Chad. Sincerely, 
<br>Mike Hausknecht</p>

            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>To whom it may concern,</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>
</p><p>Hey, I had to give some credit to Chad of Golen Engines. From the day I started to research what I wanted to do with my Jeep, his product has been on the top of my list. 
</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>It all started when I saw his engine in the Quadratec rag. Then I found a great write-up in JPMagazine called the Insane Inline. From there, link after link, everyone just raved about Golen Engines, so I emailed some questions to Chad. I found him to be very helpful as we discussed options and how my existing performance items would affect the engine. After several emails and a phone call I was ready. When I placed my order we went over everything to ensure the order was correct. A couple of days after the order he called and reconfirmed everything.</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>
</p><p>The order was shipped and received on time and much better than expected. In fact, Conn (Mig Offroad) , the guy who installed the engine made the following comment… “if that engine is built half as well as the crate it was shipped in, you got yourself one hell of an engine”… Not only did we get our engine, but also a complete packet of information from installation to recommended lubes, plugs, etc, etc and a complete break-in procedure. Nothing was left to the imagination except “how bad-ass this mother was going to run when completed” (big grin).</p><p><br></p><p>
</p><p>Through the entire install, Chad ALWAYS answered the phone and was very helpful with any questions we had. The instructions were very complete and precise, and the install went extremely smooth. The 20 minute crank breaking procedure went well and we were all very impressed.</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>
</p><p>I have since put about 1200 miles and two “wheeling days” on this engine. I run with a 3 speed automatic, and I would suggest anyone with an auto and stock breaks* UPGRADE! This bad boy has torque and you will stand on the breaks with both feet. I think the thing I like most is the way it sounds. At about 2500 RPM’s it just has a very pleasing, almost mesmerizing, hum while cruising down the road, and runs so smooth. I love it! I also like the fact that it’s so simple to maintain. No funky plugs, crazy computers or hocus pocus. It’s made to run well with the simply, common day items found at any auto store. Thumbs up!</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>
</p><p>I am a firm believer in “you get what you pay for” and I feel the value of the product and the service and support Chad has provided justified my investment. I’m looking forward to many fun “wheeling days” ahead.</p><p><br></p><p> 
</p><p>
